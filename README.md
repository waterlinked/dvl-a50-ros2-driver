# Water Linked DVL A50/A125 - ROS2 Package

There is currently no official driver for ROS2 available from Water Linked.

We have used the [ROS2 driver](https://github.com/paagutie/dvl-a50) by [Pablo](https://github.com/paagutie) with great success.

That driver has been further expanded by [Nikolas](https://github.com/ndahn), so check out that [ROS2 Driver](https://github.com/ndahn/dvl_a50) too. 

There are also other drivers available by third parties by searching [github](https://github.com/search?q=ros2%20dvl-a50&type=repositories). Thanks to everyone who has contributed code.
